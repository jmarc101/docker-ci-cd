# Docker Caching

Docker caching is a crucial mechanism that helps optimize the building of Docker images. It speeds up the image build process by reusing previously built layers when possible, rather than rebuilding them from scratch. Understanding how Docker caching works is essential to create efficient and faster Docker images.

When you build a Docker image using a Dockerfile, Docker executes each instruction in the Dockerfile to create an image layer. Each instruction in the Dockerfile generates a new layer with the changes made. These layers are read-only and stacked on top of each other to form the final image.

## Docker's Caching Mechanism

Docker's caching mechanism works based on the following principles:

1. **Layer Reuse**: Docker caches each layer created during the image build process. If you rebuild the image and none of the commands before a certain instruction (in the same order) have changed, Docker will reuse the cached layers up to that instruction. This means that those layers won't be rebuilt, significantly reducing the time needed to build the image.

2. **Layer Invalidation**: When an instruction in the Dockerfile changes (e.g., adding new code or installing additional packages), all subsequent layers in the Dockerfile are invalidated, and Docker starts building the image from that point onwards. It will execute all the instructions again, and any layers beyond the changed instruction will be rebuilt.

3. **Multi-stage Builds**: Docker multi-stage builds enable you to use multiple `FROM` statements in a single Dockerfile. Each `FROM` statement defines a new build stage. This allows you to separate the build environment from the runtime environment and ensures that only the final stage's layers are included in the resulting image. It helps to reduce the size of the final image and prevent unnecessary layers from being cached.

## Best Practices for Docker Caching

To take advantage of Docker caching effectively, you should order your Dockerfile instructions wisely. Place the instructions that change frequently (e.g., copying application source code) at the end of the Dockerfile. Instructions that change infrequently (e.g., installing system dependencies) should be placed at the beginning of the Dockerfile.

Here's an example of a Dockerfile to illustrate caching:

### First build
```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile 
# Ffirst run

# Step 1: Install system dependencies (not cached - 1st run)
FROM alpine

# Step 2: Install application dependencies (not cached)
RUN apk add --update redis
RUN apk add --update gcc

# Step 3: Copy application source code (not cached if source code changes)
COPY . .

# Step 4: Expose and run the application (not cached if source code changes)
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

### __GOOD__ second build
```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile 
# Ffirst run

# Step 1: Install system dependencies (cached from 1st build)
FROM alpine

# Step 2: Install application dependencies (cached from 1st build)
RUN apk add --update redis
RUN apk add --update gcc

# Step 3: Copy application source code (not cached if source code changes)
COPY other stuff

# Step 4: Expose and run the application (not cached if source code changes)
CMD ["redis-server"]
```


### __BAD__ second build
```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile 
# Ffirst run

# Step 1: Install system dependencies (cached from 1st build)
FROM alpine

# Step 2: Install application dependencies (not cached since gcc was originally after redis)
RUN apk add --update gcc      <----
RUN apk add --update redis    <----

# Step 3: Copy application source code (not cached if source code changes)
COPY other stuff

# Step 4: Expose and run the application (not cached if source code changes)
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

 
## **Why Docker Creates Intermediate Containers Between Each Step**
When you build a Docker image using a Dockerfile, Docker creates an **intermediate container** for each step specified in the Dockerfile. These intermediate containers are temporary and used during the build process to execute each instruction in the Dockerfile. This approach is part of Docker's build optimization strategy and helps improve image layer caching and build efficiency.

Here's why Docker creates intermediate containers between each step:

1. **Isolation and Reproducibility**: Each instruction in the Dockerfile represents a specific action, such as installing software, copying files, or running commands. By creating an intermediate container for each instruction, Docker ensures that the changes made by one instruction do not affect subsequent instructions. This provides better isolation and reproducibility during the image build process.

2. **Layer Caching**: Docker uses a layered file system for images, and each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer. When you make changes to an existing image, Docker can reuse the cached intermediate layers if the Dockerfile hasn't changed. This saves time during subsequent builds because Docker can skip the steps that haven't changed, and only the modified instructions create new layers.

3. **Incremental Building**: When you modify your application code or the Dockerfile, Docker will only rebuild the steps affected by those changes, along with any subsequent steps. The unaffected steps can be fetched from the cache. This incremental building approach speeds up the build process, especially for larger and more complex images.

4. **Cleanup**: Once an instruction in the Dockerfile is completed, Docker commits the changes to an intermediate container, creating a new image layer. Then, the temporary container is removed. This cleanup process ensures that the intermediate containers are not retained after the build, saving disk space and reducing clutter.

Overall, the use of intermediate containers in the Docker build process is an essential part of Docker's optimization and caching mechanisms. It helps reduce build times, increases efficiency, and ensures that Docker images are reproducible and reliable.

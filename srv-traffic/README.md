# Traffic Visit Counter App

This application is a simple Node.js app that uses Express and Redis to count the number of visits to a web page. It is designed to be run as a containerized application, providing a straightforward way to track the number of times the specified route has been accessed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the app's directory.

2. Install dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt in the app's directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install express redis
```
## How to Use
To run the Traffic Visit Counter app, execute the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
```
node app.js
```
By default, the app will listen on port 5000.

Endpoint the app exposes a single endpoint:

## GET /
Description: This endpoint returns the number of visits to the route.
Response: A JSON object containing the number of visits.
Example response:


```
json
{
  "visits": 5
}
```
## How It Works
- The app uses Express to create a simple web server.\
- It establishes a connection to a Redis database using the redis package.
- The app initializes the number of visits to 0 in the Redis database.
- When a user accesses the root route (/), the app retrieves the current number of visits from the Redis database.
- It responds with the number of visits to the user.
- The app increments the visit count in the Redis database.

Redis Connection
In this app, the Redis server is expected to run on the default host (localhost) and the default port (6379). If your Redis server is running on a different host or port, you can modify the connection settings in the following line of code:

```
const client = redis.createClient();
```
Replace the default parameters with your Redis server configuration. For example, if your Redis server is running on a different host and port, you can do the following:
```
const client = redis.createClient({
  host: 'your-redis-host',
  port: your-redis-port,
});
```
## Note
This app is designed for learning purposes and does not handle authentication or implement any security measures. For production use, ensure to add appropriate security mechanisms and access controls to protect your application and Redis database.
